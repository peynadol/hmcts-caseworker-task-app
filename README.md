# Caseworker Task App

A full-stack app built with **React**, **Node.js (Express)**, and **PostgreSQL**.

## üåê Live Demo  

üö´ **Important Note:**  
Due to my Render trial expiring, the backend (including the PostgreSQL database) is no longer active.  
As a result, the full functionality of the application (e.g., adding, editing, or deleting tasks) will **not work** in the live demo.

Hosted on [Render](https://hmcts-caseworker-task-app.onrender.com/)
_‚ö†Ô∏è Please note: Render may take 30‚Äì60 seconds to spin up._


## Tech Stack

This project was built as part of my application for HMCTS.
